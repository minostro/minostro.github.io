This is my third attempt to write a blog.  I don't want to fail this time, so I think I'm going to take this as a good exercise to improve my written English.  No worries, my spoken English is even worst ;-). I'm originally from Iquique - Chile.

In 2013, Groupon Inc. gave me the opportunity to be transfered from Santiago to Chicago.  After a couple of discussions between Ivania and me, we decided to accept the offer. I'm working in Chicago as a Software Engineer in the Finance Engineering Team.

My main intention is to write, in this blog, about my personal life as well as my professional experiencies.

cya,
