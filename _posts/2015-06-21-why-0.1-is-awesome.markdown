I just learned that \\( 0.1_{10} \\) cannot be represented by an exact binary number; the resulting binary number is an infinite number.

*What‽*, *How‽*

Let's transform \\( 0.1_{10} \\) to it's equivalent binary number.

| Decimal number          | Binary Result           |
|:-----------------------:|:-----------------------:|
|\\(0.1_{10} \times 2\\)  | \\(0,\\)                |
|\\(0.2_{10} \times 2\\)  | \\(0\\)                 |
|\\(0.4_{10} \times 2\\)  | \\(0\\)                 |
|\\(0.8_{10} \times 2\\)  | \\(0\\)                 |
|\\(1.6_{10} \times 2\\)  | \\(1\\)                 |
|\\(1.2_{10} \times 2\\)  | \\(1\\)                 |
|\\(0.4_{10} \times 2\\)  | \\(0\\)                 |
|\\(0.8_{10} \times 2\\)  | \\(0\\)                 |
|\\(1.6_{10} \times 2\\)  | \\(1\\)                 |
|\\(1.2_{10} \times 2\\)  | \\(1\\)                 |
|\\(0.4_{10} \times 2\\)  | \\(0\\)                 |
|\\(0.8_{10} \times 2\\)  | \\(0\\)                 |
|\\(1.6_{10} \times 2\\)  | \\(1\\)                 |
|\\(1.2_{10} \times 2\\)  | \\(1\\)                 |

The resulting binary number is \\(0.0001100110011...\\) .  The dots are there to show that there is no finite representation. \\(0011_{2}\\) is the pattern that repeats over an over again after the first \\(0\\) located after the radix point.
