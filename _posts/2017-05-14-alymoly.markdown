AlyMoly is a Point of Sales System built for a liquor store based in the city of Iquique, Chile. AlyMoly is a transactional system that processes product sales, product returns, and manages the inventory of the products. It can also generate reports regarding transactions that happened in a given period of time.

AlyMoly was built by using:
* Python 2.7
* Django 1.10
* PostgreSQL 9.5
* JQuery and JQueryUI
