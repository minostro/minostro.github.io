AlyMoly is a Point of Sale System built for a liquor store based in the city of Iquique, Chile. AlyMoly is a transactional system that processes product sales, product returns, and manages the inventory of the products. It can also generate reports regarding the transactions that happened in a given time range.

AlyMoly was built by using:
* Python 2.7
* Django 1.10
* PostgreSQL 9.5
* JQuery and JQueryUI

This was a joint effort between [Andrés Otárola](https://github.com/aotarola) and myself.
