## Overview
Join Point Interfaces is an abstraction which by design supports modular reasoning and independent evolution by decoupling aspects from base code and by providing a modular type-checking algorithm. In this post, I want to share with you how I extended the ABC compiler to implement this new abstraction as part of the AspectJ Programming Language. This work was part of my master's thesis[^1]. Ã‰ric Tanter[^2] and Eric Bodden[^3] were my advisors, and this was a joint work with them.
