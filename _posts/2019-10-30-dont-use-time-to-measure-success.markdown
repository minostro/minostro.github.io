Most of the time, I use time to measure the success of my goals. I do it all the time (pun intended):

- How long do you need to prepare for technical interviews?
- Are you moving to your new house next week?
- How many years will you live abroad before coming back to your country?

Often using time as a measurement of success is misleading. Why? Let me share with you two personal examples with you:

__Example 1: Changing Jobs__

Two years ago, I used time as of the measurements for applying to companies. I gave myself 2 months to study. When the time was up, I applied to seven companies. Result? Almost all rejections and a couple of unattractive offers. This year I went through the interview process again. Results? I got 8 offers, and I decided to join Square. The difference: This time I made sure to complete the following tasks before starting interviewing:

1. I solved 150 Leetcode problems (35 easy, 100 medium, 15 hard)
1. I solved 20 system design questions, and
1. I practiced a couple of different behavioral questions

__Example 2: Living abroad__

Six years ago, I moved to the U.S. My father asked me how long I was planning to stay abroad. You see! Time, again! 3 years, I said. Results? I am still living abroad. Again, I was using time to answer this question. This year my parents visited me, and my dad asked me the exact same question. This time, my answer was different. Dad, it’s not a matter of time but rather of savings. I would feel comfortable moving back when I have saved 1 million dollars.

You can clearly see that using time was misleading in these situations. Using time was wrong because it wasn’t an indicator to show that I was done/ready with my goals. I would love to learn more about you. Have you ever been in a situation where you used time to measure success and realized later that it wasn’t really the best way to measure it?
