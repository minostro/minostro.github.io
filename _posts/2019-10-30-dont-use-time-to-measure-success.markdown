Most of the time, I use time to measure the success of my goals. I do it all the time (pun intended):

- How long do you need to prepare for technical interviews?
- Are you moving to your new house next week?
- How many years will you live abroad before coming back to your country?

Often using time as a measurement of success is misleading. Why? Let me share with two personal examples with you:

__Example 1: Changing Jobs__

Two years ago, I used time as of the measurements for applying to companies. I gave myself 2 months to study. When the time was up, I applied to seven companies. __Result?__ Almost all rejections and a couple of unattractive offers. This year I went through the interview process again. __Results?__ I got 8 offers, and I decided to join Square. The difference: This time I made sure to complete the following tasks before starting interviewing:

1. I solved 150 Leetcode problems (35 easy, 100 medium, 15 hard)
1. I solved 20 system design questions, and
1. I practiced a couple of different behavioral questions

__Example 2: Living abroad__

Six years ago, I moved to the U.S. My father asked me how long I was planning to stay abroad. You see! Time, again! 3 years, I said. __Results?__ I am still living abroad. Again, I was using time to answer this question. This year my parents visited me, and my dad asked me the exact same question. __Results?__ Dad, it’s not a matter of time but rather of savings. I would feel comfortable moving back when I have saved at least 1 million dollars.

___
You can clearly see that using time was misleading in these situations. Using time was wrong because it wasn’t an indicator to determine that I was done/ready with my goals. Have you ever been in a situation where you used time to measure success and realized later that it wasn’t really the best way to measure it?
