# Remote work
A worker is said to be performing remote work when they are situated far from the location of their teammates. This person can be working from home, a shared working space, or any other location. Remote work can be performed on a temporary or permanent basis.

Embracing remote work poses challenges at different levels of the organization.It is important to recognize that no oly Remote Workers are responsibles to making this work. The company and Co-located teammates are equually important on this. The following four sections of this post identify challenges these individuals will face and provide, wherever possible, some guidelines to help them overcome these challenges:

This section covers the biggest challenge remote workers are faced with and provides some guidelines on how tackle them

### Collaboration
* Do *not* isolate yourself and do *not* let the team isolate you.
* Look for opportunities to have pairing/discussion sessions with your teammates to increase cross-pollination.
* Do * not* hesitate to have a video conference with your teammates especially for project kick-off.
* If possible, it's a good idea to visit offices on a regular cadence if you think that will give a boost to collaboration. 

### Communication
* Make your messages clear, self-contained and as concise as possible.
* Enrich the communication channel. Remember that there is a screen in between. Use diagrams/flow charts/images when explaining ideas or concepts to your teammates. Don't rely on your body language.
* Share as many decisions/knowledge/context online as possible.

### Accountability
* Be aware that you are out sight. Help your teammates to understand what you are doing, and what you are planning to do.
* Be resourceful by reaching out to your teammates whenever you think you could help them or whenever you think they can unblock you.
* Be proactive about helping the team to be more remote-friendly, e.g.: Use a Trello board rather than a whiteboard for retros.

### Community
* Develop a sense of belonging by engaging in activities that involve people outside of your team.
* Show your teammates that you care about what they do by asking questions regarding their projects/lives anytime you feel is appropriate.
* Learn as much as possible about how and why the team does things in a certain way during the onboarding process.

Most of the guidelines have an implicit dependency on tooling: Slack, Jira, Google Docs, Github, Google Hangouts, Trello, Tuple, among others. Use these tools and also don't hesistate to find new ones that are better suited for a given situation.
