I am currently working on the Financial Engineering Team (FED) at
Groupon Inc., Chicago, USA.  The main goal of having this blog is to
get better at writing.  Some posts will only contain source code or
equations. At some point, I should be able to tell a story rather than
only providing code or equations.
